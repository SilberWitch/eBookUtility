= Relay Test: TheForest

== Purpose

This is a test of writing directly to the relay *wss://theforest.nostr1.com*.

If you can see this file, it means that the upload was successful and you are either reading from the same relay, or from a relay that has since copied the original test event.

Happy reading!
